Download random music from multiple sources:
1. Reddit
2. Last.fm (popular and new releases)
3. Album of the Year (Monthly)
4. Kral Muzik
5. Karnaval Muzik
6. TRT Muzik


+ Modify `music_dl/config.py` for the sources
+ Modify `music_dl/scrapers/<scraper>.py` for further configuration (i.e. subreddits, trtmuzik playlist)

#+begin_src bash
uv run main.py
#+end_src

Problems:
1. For reddit it takes the top-level comment (which might contain more than just a song name) and
   searches on Youtube which often can give the wrong result
2. It tries to avoid double checking the subreddit posts and re-downloading the songs but if the
   list is not updated at a fine granularity and if the script stops for any reason, there is a good
   possibility that the titles are already added to the list and will be ignored the next time
3. Relies on scraping and might get stuck at Cloudflare (RateYourMusic is constantly stuck)


* TODO List
  I doubt I'll go through these but just in case

  + Add configuration (subreddit, playlist)
  + Improve duplicate detection
  + Handle errors better
  + Handle Spotify Links
